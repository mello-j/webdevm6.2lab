# Project Description

This project was to create a very visually appealing letterhead template using advanced CSS techniques, and a Lorem Ipsum generator for text.

## Running the Website

1. To run everything you will need to Fork or Clone this repository and open in up in an IDE on your local PC or in VS Codespaces.

2. Once you have cloned the Repo, open it up in VS Code.

3. Select the index.html file from the Explorer Window.

4. Then, using the VS Code Command Palette, type: > Live Preview Start Server. If this command is not available, you may need to install the VS Code Live Preview extension.

5. This will open up a website preview within your IDE. You can also open this in an external browser if you choose, by clicking on the 3 horizontal lines icon to the top right of the preview window and selecting 'Open in Browser'.


## Sources and Credits
I used a lot of previous knowledge in playing around with this one. That may have made it more difficult as I tried to accomplish things with that I know versus using new items that were covered in the reading that would have made this much easier/more efficient. I hope to review some of the previous weeks reading in addition to the next modules content and get caught up soon as work should slow down in the next week or two.

Text was taken directly from the Lorem Ipsum generator (and some code examples were used as reference points although nothing was copied exactly.)

## Closing thoughts
This lab really wasn't that bad aside from being pressed for time (trying to complete the lab, code reviews, reflection, and another course assignment). I need to get a bit ahead on the reading and lab overview next time, so that when the lab is due, I already have those portions at least complete and an idea where to begin. Time management killed me this week (so did work).

Other thoughts are I need to take more time and read through the CSS examples and provided docs, I know the overflow content would have saved me a TON of time instead of playing with sizing/flex/margins and padding. I also need to spend more time looking at the box model so I can know what's going on quicker in my head versus having to pull up reference docs. The bulk of the time of this lab for me was dealing with the excess content in the main content section overflowing into my bottom image and address section. While I probably could have just overwritten the positioning value of the article, I was attempting to do the lab where I'm only touching the code I'm allowed to (and ignoring anything else). What I know now has been confirmed....my CSS sucks but my html/javascript is at least passing.
I plan to spend a lot more time on CSS in future labs and playing around with this lab when I have some spare time.
